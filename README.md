# About the Site

The site started out as taking notes while learning to code. It grew, then the website came. Over time I found it to be useful, so I started sharing it. Now it works as a learning tool (for myself) and hopefully learning and reference resource for others.

But the heart of it remains this - this is a dummy site and not a real project. I intend on making open source stuff in the future (probably a few years), and while doing so plan to keep this site updated with snippets and reference documents for whatever learn.

The gitHub repositories are like the site; a means of learning.
